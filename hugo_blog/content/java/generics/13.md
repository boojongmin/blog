### 하위 제한 와일드카드  `Lower Bounded Wildcards`

상위제한와일드카드 섹션은 특정 타입이나 그 특정타입의  서브타입을 알 수 없을때는 'extends' 키워드를 사용하는 것을 보여줬다. 비슷한 것으로, 하위제한와일드카드는 특정타입이나 그 특정 타입의 슈퍼타입을 제한하고자할때 사용한다.
`The Upper Bounded Wildcards section shows that an upper bounded wildcard restricts the unknown type to be a specific type or a subtype of that type and is represented using the extends keyword. In a similar way, a lower bounded wildcard restricts the unknown type to be a specific type or a super type of that type.`

`A lower bounded wildcard is expressed using the wildcard character ('?'), following by the super keyword, followed by its lower bound: <? super A>.`

`Note: You can specify an upper bound for a wildcard, or you can specify a lower bound, but you cannot specify both.`
`Say you want to write a method that puts Integer objects into a list. To maximize flexibility, you would like the method to work on List<Integer>, List<Number>, and List<Object> — anything that can hold Integer values.`

`To write the method that works on lists of Integer and the supertypes of Integer, such as Integer, Number, and Object, you would specify List<? super Integer>. The term List<Integer> is more restrictive than List<? super Integer> because the former matches a list of type Integer only, whereas the latter matches a list of any type that is a supertype of Integer.`

`The following code adds the numbers 1 through 10 to the end of a list:`

```java
public static void addNumbers(List<? super Integer> list) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        list.add(i);
    }
}
```
`The Guidelines for Wildcard Use section provides guidance on when to use upper bounded wildcards and when to use lower bounded wildcards.`
