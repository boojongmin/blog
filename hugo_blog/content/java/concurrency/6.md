### 인터럽트
`Interrupts`

인터럽트는 쓰레드에 태스크를 멈추고 다른 태스크를 동작시키는 표시이다(;;;). 인터럽트는 쓰레드 응답을 정확히 결정하는 것은 프로그래머의 몫이지만 매우 일반적으로 쓰레드는 종료된다. 이번 수업에서 강조하는 사용법입니다. 
`An interrupt is an indication to a thread that it should stop what it is doing and do something else. It's up to the programmer to decide exactly how a thread responds to an interrupt, but it is very common for the thread to terminate. This is the usage emphasized in this lesson.`


`A thread sends an interrupt by invoking interrupt on the Thread object for the thread to be interrupted. For the interrupt mechanism to work correctly, the interrupted thread must support its own interruption.`

#### 인터럽트 지원
`Supporting Interruption`

어떻게 쓰레드가 자신의 인트럽트를 지원할까요? 이건 InterruptedException에 의존이 있다. 그건 run 메서드에서 예외를 잡은후 예외를 반환합니다. 예를들면 Runnable 객체의 run 메서드에 메세지 출력하는 반복문이 있다고 가정하자. 그런후 인터럽트를 지원하도록 다음과 같이  수정될 수 있다. 

`How does a thread support its own interruption? This depends on what it's currently doing. If the thread is frequently invoking methods that throw InterruptedException, it simply returns from the run method after it catches that exception. For example, suppose the central message loop in the SleepMessages example were in the run method of a thread's Runnable object. Then it might be modified as follows to support interrupts:`

```java
for (int i = 0; i < importantInfo.length; i++) {
    // Pause for 4 seconds
    try {
        Thread.sleep(4000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        // We've been interrupted: no more messages.
        return;
    }
    // Print a message
    System.out.println(importantInfo[i]);
}
```

sleep과 같은 InterruptedException를 던지는 많은 메서드들은 인터럽트를 받으면 현재 작업을 취소하고 즉각적으로 반환하도록 설계되어져있다.
`Many methods that throw InterruptedException, such as sleep, are designed to cancel their current operation and return immediately when an interrupt is received.`


`What if a thread goes a long time without invoking a method that throws InterruptedException? Then it must periodically invoke Thread.interrupted, which returns true if an interrupt has been received. For example:`

```java
for (int i = 0; i < inputs.length; i++) {
    heavyCrunch(inputs[i]);
    if (Thread.interrupted()) {
        // We've been interrupted: no more crunching.
        return;
    }
}
```

`In this simple example, the code simply tests for the interrupt and exits the thread if one has been received. In more complex applications, it might make more sense to throw an InterruptedException:`

```java
if (Thread.interrupted()) {
    throw new InterruptedException();
}
```

`This allows interrupt handling code to be centralized in a catch clause.`

#### The Interrupt Status Flag

`The interrupt mechanism is implemented using an internal flag known as the interrupt status. Invoking Thread.interrupt sets this flag. When a thread checks for an interrupt by invoking the static method Thread.interrupted, interrupt status is cleared. The non-static isInterrupted method, which is used by one thread to query the interrupt status of another, does not change the interrupt status flag.`



`By convention, any method that exits by throwing an InterruptedException clears interrupt status when it does so. However, it's always possible that interrupt status will immediately be set again, by another thread invoking interrupt.`
